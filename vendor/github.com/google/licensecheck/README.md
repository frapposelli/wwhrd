# Licensecheck

The `licensecheck` package scans source texts for known licenses.
The design aims never to give a false positive.
It also reports matches of known license URLs.

See the [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/licensecheck)
for API details.

The license scanner recognizes nearly all the licenses gathered by the SPDX project,
along with a few others.

See [licenses/README.md](licenses/README.md) for license details.
