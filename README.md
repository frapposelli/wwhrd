# WWHRD? (What Would Henry Rollins Do?) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/frapposelli/wwhrd/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/frapposelli/wwhrd/tree/master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/frapposelli/wwhrd/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/frapposelli/wwhrd)

Have Henry Rollins check vendored licenses in your Go project.

Please note that `wwhrd` **only checks** packages stored under `vendor/`, if you are using Go modules (`go mod`), you can add `go mod vendor` before running `wwhrd`, this will dump a copy of the vendored packages inside the local repo.

## Installation

```console
go get -u github.com/frapposelli/wwhrd
```

Using [Brew](https://brew.sh) on macOS:

```console
brew install frapposelli/tap/wwhrd
```

## Configuration file

Configuration for `wwhrd` is stored in `.wwhrd.yml` at the root of the repo you want to check.

The format is borrowed from [Anderson](https://github.com/xoebus/anderson) and it's 1:1 compatible (just run `wwhrd check -f .anderson.yml`).

```yaml
---
blacklist:
  - GPL-2.0

whitelist:
  - Apache-2.0
  - MIT

exceptions:
  - github.com/jessevdk/go-flags
  - github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib
```

Having a license in the `blacklist` section will fail the check, unless the package is listed under `exceptions`.

`exceptions` can also be listed as wildcards:

```yaml
exceptions:
  - github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew/...
```

Will make a blanket exception for all the packages under `github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew`.

Use it in your CI!

```console
$ wwhrd check
